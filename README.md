# University-AI-Map-App

## Introduction
This is a map application for my university that helps visitors find the best routes between buildings, venues, and other points of interest on the campus. The application provides all the paths, venues, and buildings indicated on the map and offers advice on the best route based on various factors such as distance, human or vehicle traffic, and wheel chair accessibility.

## Features
The application offers the following features:
* A map of the campus with all the buildings, venues, and paths indicated.
* The ability to provide a user with the best route between two points based on distance, traffic, and wheel chair accessibility.
* The ability to provide multiple options where more than one path exists.
* The ability to advise a user who wishes to go to more than one destination on the best path to take.
* A heuristics option that is based on the Manhattan distance.
* Constraints or logical rules to enrich the solution.
